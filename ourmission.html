    <h1> OUR MISSION </h1>

    <p id = "benefits"> Our mission is to stop the production of gas-reliant cars and turn the U.S. automobile market fully electric. There are many advantages to owning an electric car. For instance, they are better for the environment because they are not gas-dependent and instead rely on electricity, which is a renewable energy source. They are also less expensive to maintain since you no longer have to pay for gas. There are over 900 supercharging stations across the U.S. and it is unlikely that you will have to worry about your car running out of charge while out and about. The government also offers tax deductions to owners of electric vehicles. </p>
